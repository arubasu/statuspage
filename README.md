## [status.cdnjs.com](https://status.cdnjs.com)

This repository is a store of all the customisations that we have made to our statuspage.io website at
[status.cdnjs.com](https://status.cdnjs.com).

Statuspage allow you to customise the color theme that you use for the page as well as providing custom CSS for the site
and custom HTML in the header/footer.

This means that if you wish to change styles of the site, this can be easily achieved using the custom CSS section but
any manipulation of the DOM will need to be done through Javascript that gets injected into the footer of the website.

## Customisations

 - Color theme: [colors.md](colors.md)
